# Tools and Integrations

- Tool contracts: typed schemas, clear errors, timeouts, retries
- Idempotency: safe replays; deduplicate with request IDs
- Least privilege: scoped tokens, per-tool allowlists, masked secrets
- Observability: per-tool latency, errors, cost, inputs/outputs
- Testing: simulators/mocks; golden traces of complex sessions
