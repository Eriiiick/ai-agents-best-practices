# Reasoning and Prompting

- System prompts: define scope, constraints, and quality bar
- Decomposition: break tasks into steps; use checklists
- Self-critique: require model to verify outputs against acceptance criteria
- Tool-aware prompting: show schemas and examples for each tool
- State handling: include only necessary context; avoid prompt bloat
- Guard-rails in prompts: refusal policies, safe defaults, escalation
