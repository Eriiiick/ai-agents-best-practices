# Observability and Ops

- Tracing: full task graphs, prompts, tool I/O, costs
- Live dashboards: SLOs for quality, latency, failure modes
- Feedback ingestion: thumbs, comments, corrective examples
- Incident response: playbooks for hallucinations and tool failures
- Continuous improvement: weekly triage of logs + evals
