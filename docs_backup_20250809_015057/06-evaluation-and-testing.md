# Evaluation and Testing

- Golden datasets: representative, versioned, privacy-safe
- Multi-metric: quality, safety, cost, latency, regressions
- Red-teaming: adversarial prompts + tool misuse scenarios
- CI gating: block merges on eval regressions beyond thresholds
- Shadow launches: observe with guardrails before GA
