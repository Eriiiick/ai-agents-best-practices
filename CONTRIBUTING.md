# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This repo aims to be crisp, pragmatic, and vendor-neutral.

- Keep documents concise, link to deeper resources when helpful
- Prefer actionable checklists and templates over long prose
- When adding claims, include references or empirical evidence when possible
- Use inclusive, clear language; avoid hype

Process:
1. Fork and create a branch
2. Make edits in `docs/` or `docs/checklists/` or `docs/templates/`
3. Open a PR with a short summary and why it helps readers
