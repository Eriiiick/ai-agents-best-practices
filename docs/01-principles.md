# Principles

- Reliability over cleverness: favor determinism via evals, constraints, and fallback paths.
- Safety by design: prevent unsafe actions by default; least-privilege tools and allowlists.
- Human-in-the-loop where stakes are high; automate handoffs and escalation.
- Observability first: logs, traces, and feedback loops from day one.
- Data minimization: collect only what you need; expire and delete aggressively.
- Progressive disclosure in UX: show confidence, costs, and controls.
- Cost-awareness: track per-request and per-task costs; budget and throttle.
- Version everything: prompts, tools, routing logic, eval suites.
