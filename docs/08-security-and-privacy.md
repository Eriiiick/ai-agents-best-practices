# Security and Privacy

- Data minimization: collect least necessary; set TTLs
- Secrets: vault + short-lived tokens; no secrets in prompts/logs
- Access control: RBAC for tools, datasets, admin surfaces
- PII handling: classification, redaction, encryption at rest/in flight
- Compliance: data residency and retention requirements
